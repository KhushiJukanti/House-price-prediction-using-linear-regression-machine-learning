House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression Machine Learning
This project aims to predict house prices using the Linear Regression machine learning algorithm. Linear Regression is a widely used algorithm for regression tasks, and it's a good fit for predicting house prices as it attempts to establish a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (price).

Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of various features related to houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, etc., along with their corresponding prices. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of the model.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

-Python 3.x
-Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

You also need to install the following Python libraries:

-NumPy
-Pandas
-Scikit-learn
-You can install them using pip, like this:

Usage

-Clone this repository or download the project files to your local machine.
-Launch Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE.
-Open the house_price_prediction.ipynb file.
-Run the notebook cell by cell to see the code and execute it.
-Follow the comments and instructions provided in the notebook to understand the steps involved in house price prediction using linear regression.

Steps

-Load and explore the dataset: In this step, we load the dataset using Pandas and explore its structure, statistical summary, and feature distributions.

-Data preprocessing: This step involves handling missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.

-Feature selection: We select the relevant features that have a strong correlation with the target variable (price).

-Model training: We split the dataset into training and test sets, and then train the Linear Regression model using the training data.

-Model evaluation: We evaluate the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

-Prediction: Finally, we use the trained model to make predictions on new data (test set) and compare the predicted prices with the actual prices.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression for house price prediction. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can understand the workflow and implement similar regression tasks using different datasets.

Note: The accuracy of the prediction may vary depending on the dataset and features used. It's always recommended to explore and preprocess the data properly to obtain more accurate results.
